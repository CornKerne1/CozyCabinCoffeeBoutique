* [Hi! How's it going?]

-It's going alright...got word from my family back in the City of Mallory that rent is at an all time high...they really are pushing us, aren't they?
* [That's partly why I ventured out of Mallory; this place is much more affordable and cozy.]

-Agreed! This shop is very welcoming.
