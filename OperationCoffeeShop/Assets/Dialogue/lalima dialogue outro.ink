Now that’s a good cup of coffee! Say, where did you say you were from?
* [I’m from the city, but…I, err, won this shop in a lottery.]

- I’m Lalima and I’m a traveling mushroom farmer.
* [I've never heard of a traveling mushroom farmer before.]

- My family's farm is the one and only! I’ll make sure to tell all my clients about this place! You have a nice day, now.
* [See you later, Lalima.]
